# Windows 10 Default app associations
Windows 10 default app association


The default apps xml basically tells windows what application to use for what kind of file. You can add or remove what is necessary. This particular xml is set up for MS office 2016 NOT O365, and also "Adobe Acrobat Reader DC" should work for Acrobat DC as well. This must be taken into account in script 1 as well for the location when you set it
